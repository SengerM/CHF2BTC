# CHF2BTC

Bitcoin (BTC) price as measured in Swiss Francs (CHF), since the beginning of time.

Though packages such as [ccxt](https://docs.ccxt.com) provide easy and real-time access to the valuation of Bitcoin in Swiss Francs by fetching data from different exchanges, the data only goes as back as the exchange has been in operation. So far, the oldest data I found is from 2023. This can be limiting for data analysis. So I created this repository to easily get the price since the beginning of time, by computing an estimation through the USD/CHF price.
